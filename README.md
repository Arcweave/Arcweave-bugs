# Arcweave bug reports

This is where we handle public bug report submissions for [Arcweave](https://arcweave.com/).

# Submission guidelines

In order for us to be able to replicate the issue we need clear and adequate information. Please follow these guidelines to help us fix the bug you're reporting.

## Make sure it's really a bug

Many bug reports are actually just misunderstood features. If possible double-check with the mods in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/atVXxAK) before submitting here.

## Only mention one problem per issue

Please only describe one problem in each issue you create. This helps us better assign, track, solve and deploy issues faster. It also keeps things neat.

## Voting on bugs
You can add a "+1" reaction to a bug report to indicate you are also interested in that bug. When viewing an issue, there is an "Add your reaction" button in the top-right corner. Click on that and select the "thumbs up" (+1) reaction.

This provides a basic voting system, so we can better prioritise issues that many people have voted for.

You can also subscribe to issues using the button to the right of the issue. This will create a notification on GitHub whenever the issue is updated.
